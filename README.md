## AWS Spark Streaming with Unstructured Data:

This project implements a real-time data streaming pipeline using Apache Spark and AWS services to process, transform, and analyze unstructured data such as text files, JSON, PDFs, and images. The solution aims to handle diverse file formats, extract meaningful insights, and store the processed data in a structured format for downstream analysis and reporting. Spark Streaming is used to enable real-time ingestion and transformation of data, while AWS S3 serves as the primary storage layer for raw and processed data. Processed data is cataloged using AWS Glue and loaded into Amazon Redshift for querying and visualization. Tools like Tableau, Power BI, and Plotly are used to generate reports and gain insights from the processed data.

The system architecture consists of multiple components working together. First, data is ingested from various input directories corresponding to different file types, which are continuously monitored by Spark Streaming. The Spark cluster, comprising a driver node and multiple worker nodes, processes the data in parallel using custom-defined User-Defined Functions (UDFs) to extract relevant information. The processed data is stored in AWS S3 and organized using AWS Glue, while further transformations enable loading into Amazon Redshift for advanced analysis. Finally, the data can be visualized using popular business intelligence tools to meet reporting and decision-making needs.

Docker is employed in this project to containerize the Spark infrastructure, ensuring portability, scalability, and consistent environments across development, testing, and deployment stages. The Docker setup, defined in a docker-compose.yml file, includes containers for the Spark master and worker nodes, making it easy to scale the cluster by adding or removing workers as needed. This approach simplifies dependency management and ensures reproducibility across different platforms.

To use the project, the Spark cluster can be initialized using Docker Compose by running the docker-compose up -d command. Files to be processed should be placed in the respective input directories, such as input_text or input_json. The processed data is stored in Amazon S3, and further analysis can be performed using visualization tools. This project has been tested primarily with text and JSON file formats, while support for other file types, including PDFs, images, and Excel, is included but not yet fully validated.

In summary, this project demonstrates an end-to-end solution for real-time streaming, processing, and analysis of unstructured data using Apache Spark and AWS services. Docker ensures seamless deployment and scalability, while the integration with AWS provides a robust and efficient cloud-based infrastructure for data storage, processing, and visualization.
